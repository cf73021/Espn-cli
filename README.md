# ESPN::Cli
The ESPN::CLI gem was built to display the top 10 headlines on the front page of ESPN.com for you. Upon seeing the headlines, you can then select a number to view a bit more information about that article.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'espn-cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install espn-cli

## Usage

To use this application, simply call the gem, then enter a number from 1-10 to choose which article you would like more information about.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
